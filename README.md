# EV Segmentation and Market Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting the electric vehicle (EV) market using clustering techniques. The goal is to categorize EVs based on various vehicle features to help manufacturers and stakeholders identify target segments for future growth and product development.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to segment the EV market by applying clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction. Key tasks include:

- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the EV market trends and characteristics.
- Applying K-Means Clustering to group vehicles into distinct segments.
- Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and to improve clustering performance.
- Predicting future demand for EV segments using time series forecasting models.
- Analyzing the results to identify the most promising EV segments based on market demand.

## Models and Techniques
The following models and techniques were applied in the project:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means Clustering
- Market Demand Prediction (ARIMA)


## Process
1. **Data Preprocessing and Analysis:**
*The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, standardize vehicle attributes, and transform features for clustering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover key trends in the dataset, such as the distribution of vehicle categories and regional preferences.*
2. **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:**
*PCA was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, retaining the most informative features for clustering.
This step helped improve the efficiency and accuracy of the clustering process by eliminating redundant information.*
3. **Clustering and Segmentation:**
*The K-Means algorithm was implemented to segment the EV market. The optimal number of clusters was determined using methods such as the elbow method and silhouette scores.
Clusters were analyzed to interpret the characteristics of each segment, providing actionable insights into which EV types are most popular and in demand.*
4. **Forecasting Future Demand:**
*ARIMA models were used to predict future trends in EV demand, considering seasonality and historical sales data.*

## Conclusion
This project successfully segmented the EV market using K-Means clustering and dimensionality reduction with PCA. The clusters provided clear insights into the types of EVs that are in demand across different regions and vehicle categories. Furthermore, demand prediction models helped forecast future growth, offering valuable guidance for manufacturers and stakeholders in the EV market.
